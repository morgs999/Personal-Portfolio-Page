# Morgan Clarke's Portfolio

## A Portfolio to Submit to Potential Employers
This website will serve as a collection of samples that I've coded from scratch, either in HTML and CSS or Python.

It will allow any interested employers to quickly and dynamically view the work I've done in multiple languages and frameworks.

 - ### Python Programs through custom built programs

     - A bank account creator, that can print balances or lists of transaction with timestamps
